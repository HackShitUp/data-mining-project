### Handle imbalanced dataset
  * look at data, see how imbalanced it is
  * either use oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE to deal with it 

### Imputation (filling in empty data)
  * using mean, median, or mode (notes say mode for discrete, mean or meadian for continuous) 
  * use KNN, SVM, or naive bayes for discrete variables or regression classifier for continuous variables
  
### Code algorithms
  * any classification algorithms 
  * KNN, SVM, random forrest, etc

### Choose best 3 or 4 algorithms and put them together

### Get majority vote on each data point

### Calculate accuracies

### Confusion matrix 

### Write up
