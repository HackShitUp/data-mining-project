# Objective
The objective of this project is the following:
```
Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year. You should use census-income.data to train your classifier and use census-income.test to evaluate the performance of your learning algorithm.
```
Our algorithm manages the following inconsistencies:
```
– Handling imbalanced dataset (aka different amounts of positive and negative labels).
– Proper imputation methods for missing values.
– Different treatment of various type of features: continuous, discrete, categorical, etc.
```
